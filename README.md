## Background: Last years increase of classified hate crimes in Sweden

My final project focusing on the increased number of hate crimes in Sweden during 2015. [The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/about-bra.html) produces data and research to provide knowledge and assist crime prevention work. [Their published statistic](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/hate-crime.html) shows that the number of hate crimes with xenophobic/racist motive increased from 2013. The increase was most significant during 2015. Religious motives, such as Christianophobic or Islamophobic increased significantly, while motives due to sexual orientation have slowly gone down from 2013. The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention gathers data from police reports identified as hate crime motives. But the number of police reports can only provide indications of how hate crimes are noted in police reports but it says very little about the incidence of hate in society because most criminal events are not reported to police. 

Among the hate crimes that often don't show up in police reports, are fires in asylum accommodations. Inhabitat accommodations that house people who seek asylum in Sweden or Inhabitat accommodations that are being planned as asylum housing. People live there temporarily while waiting for an answer if they are allowed to stay in Sweden or are forced to leave. From 2013, media have frequently reported about fires. The number of firefighters emergency operations to asylum housing went from around 20 (2012-2014) to 78 (2015). The statistic is provided by MSB – Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency that in June 2016 published a report that seeks to summarize the current state, on behalf of the Swedish government. The report also shows that of the 78 incidents in 2015;
* 16 "started" from the outside 
* 11 from the inside
* 27 categorized as accidents (for example cooking, candles)
* 6 due to Suicide attempts/mental illness 
* 14 unknown
* 4 data not available

## Narrative: Timeline Visualization

To understand the data and increased number of fires at asylum accomodation I've tried to give a brief understanding of the context and political situation in Sweden. These are mentioned as 'Context' in the timeline and provides a backdrop to the fire attacks and incidents. Three paralel stories are linked togheter; 1) People who are forced to flee their home and seek asylum elsewhere. 2) Bad conditions on the accomodations for people who seek asylum in Sweden 3) The national-conservative, anti-immigration political partie (Sweden Democrats (SD))that gain peoples votes for their drastic and inhumane immigration policies.   

1) During the Syrian Civil War (started 2011) many many thousand of people was killed and many are forced to flee the war, seeking safety in neighboring countries Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Many seeks asylum in Turkey, Lebanon, Libanon and Europe. During 2015 Sweden experience the highest number of people applying for asylum in Sweden ever. The forcast shows no signs that the refugee stream will reduce, and Sweden are worried not being able to maintain a sustainable and working immigration system. The Swedish political parties agrees to put constraints and tighten the of asylum policy, making it harder for people to seek asylum. The Migration Minister warns that there might not be any accomodations left and refugees are forced to sleep outdoors, as the Swedish Migration Agency is unable to obtain the number of accommodation places as needed. November 24th, at a press conference, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and Deputy Prime Minister Åsa Romson, announces that Swedish migration policy is adapted to the EU's minimum level.

2) The people who can seek asylum in Sweden are located to accomodation in bad condition. The Migration Agency pays private subcontractors to provide housing but puts very low requirements on quality of the housing and staff. In a study it appears that many of the private subcontractors make exceptionally large profits, while flaws about the housing are reported.

3) Sweden Democrats (far-right, national-conservative, anti-immigration) goes from 5.7% votes 2010 to 12.86% 2014 and today's polls shows 17.2%. The party have roots in Swedish fascism and white supremacy and people in the founding party have expressed strong support to nazism. Their political views gain footholds during times of fincial instability, reported terror attacs and fears for the future. 

Almost every week during 2015 new fires are reported at asylum accomodations. Media give it some attention but very little investment are made to solve these crimes or incidents. And new fires are still being reported. With this visualisation I hope to give some attention to the situation asylum seekers live in, and how little attention and support that are provided from the Swedish Guvernment to respond and act.

### Visualization
Before visualizing I went back to analyze and get inspiration from timeline and map data visualizations that have been presented in class and that I've seen before. [The Hart Island Project](https://www.hartisland.net/burial_records/map) "provides access to information about the burials on Hart Island" and tells the stories about the people who once was buried there. [Propublica Louisiana](http://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/) gives information about how the coastal landscape outside Lousiana have changed due to the rising sea level. [Drones Attacks Packistan](http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/) guides the viewer through the story of drones attacks in Pakistan. 

I used [Tiki-Toki](https://www.tiki-toki.com/) to illustrate my Timeline graph. This is a simple tool that renders the timeline based on information provided. Beside color scheme, there's decision to be made about the graphics style and structure. The categories, view type, zoom, and spacing is mayor settings to be made. They support different media sources, like video, image, and audio.  

This is a [style guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HL4apfugezWc4-l2O0Kdm9mZONv9z3Lseq1X8V0as9M/edit#slide=id.p)for my final project. 

## Description, Usage, and Analyse of Data

For information about the fire incidents, I gathered news notifications published at [Sveriges Radio (SR)](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2438&artikel=5839007). Sveriges Radio is a non-commercial, independent public service radio broadcaster that provides high quality, impartial, and accurate news and programs for the Swedish population.

Data, statistics and analysis of the fires, was gathered from a [this report](https://www.msb.se/Upload/Kunskapsbank/Olycksundersokningar_ovrigt/Lagesbeskrivning_kring_brander_i_flyktingboenden_2012-2016.pdf)by MSB – Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.

Background data and hate crimes statistics were gathered from [Brottsförebyggande rådet (Brå)](https://www.bra.se/brott-och-statistik/statistiska-undersokningar/hatbrottsstatistik.html) and from a [summerized report from 2015](https://www.bra.se/download/18.3c6dfe1e15691e1603eb65e3/1474958157817/2016_15_Hatbrott_2015.pdf)
