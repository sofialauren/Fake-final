## Background: Last years increase of classified hate crimes in Sweden

My final project focusing on the increased number of hate crimes in Sweden during 2015. [The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/about-bra.html) produces data and research to provide knowledge and assist crime prevention work. [Their published statistic](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/hate-crime.html) shows that the number of hate crimes with xenophobic / racist motive increased from 2013. The increase was most significant during 2015. Motives due to religious preferances, such as Christianophobic or Islamophobic have a significant increase, while motives due to sexual orientation have slowly gone down from 2013. The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention gathers data from police reports identified as hate crime motives. But the number of police reports can only provide indications of how hate crimes are noted in police reports but it says very little about the incidence of hate in society because most criminal events are not reported to police. 

Among the hate crimes that often don't show up in police reports, are fires in asylum accomodations. Inhabitat accomodations that houses people who seek asulym in Sweden or unhabitat accomodations that are being planned as asylum housing. People live there temporarly while waiting for an answer if they are allowed to stay in Sweden or are forst to leave. From 2013, media have frequently reported about fires. The number of firefighters emergancey oporations to asylum housing went from around 20 (2012-2014) to 78 (2015). The statistic is provided by MSB – Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency that in june 2016 published a report that seeks to summerize the current state, on behalf of the Swedish government. The report also shows that of the 78 incidents in 2015;
* 16 "started" from the outside 
* 11 from the inside
* 27 categrised as accidents (for example cooking, candles)
* 6 due to Suicide attempts/mental illness 
* 14 uknown
* 4 data not available

## Narrative: Timeline Visualization

To understand the data and increased number of fires at asylum accomodation I've tried to give a brief understanding of the context and political situation in Sweden. These are mentioned as 'Political Context' in the timeline. 

During the Syrian Civil War (started 2011) 250 000 thousand people was killed. The poeple who can are fleeing the war, seeking safety in neighboring countries Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Turkey receives nearly two million, Lebanon over one million and Jordan about 600,000. Over 500 000 seeks asylum within the Europeing Union during 2015, Germany is the country by far who receives most asylum seekers. The European cooperation shows unstability and refugees jepardycing their lifes to seek safety in Europe. Greece collapses and people are trying to get north. Several countries in Europeen Union regulates the intake with border checks when the number of refugees is considered unsustainable. 24 000 people seeks asylum in Sweden, september 2015, thats the dubble as in august and the Swedish Migration Authority sees no signs of slowdown. Never before have so many people applied for asylum in Sweden. The 23 october many Swedish political parties reach an agreement to on migration policy. The agreement contains tightening of the refugee policy.

What happened during 2015
Flyktingkris, mottagning Sverige
Migrationsverket sätts ur spel
Dåliga byggnader, små kommuner och byar, inkomstkälla för både kommunen och enskilda fastighetssägare - tar dåligt ansvar

## Description, Usage and Analyse of Data

For information about the fire incidents I gathered news notifications published at [Sveriges Radio (SR)](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2438&artikel=5839007). Sveriges Radio is a non-commercial, independent public service radio broadcaster that provide high quality, impartial, and accurate news and programs for the Swedish population.

Data, statistics and analyse of the fires, was gathered from a [this report](https://www.msb.se/Upload/Kunskapsbank/Olycksundersokningar_ovrigt/Lagesbeskrivning_kring_brander_i_flyktingboenden_2012-2016.pdf)by MSB – Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.

Backgorund data and hate crimes statistics was gathered from [Brottsförebyggande rådet (Brå)](https://www.bra.se/brott-och-statistik/statistiska-undersokningar/hatbrottsstatistik.html) and from a [summerized report from 2015](https://www.bra.se/download/18.3c6dfe1e15691e1603eb65e3/1474958157817/2016_15_Hatbrott_2015.pdf)
